// NOTE: console.log prints text to the browser console that you can enable
//       to see the output. It is a little bit more convenient than alert so
//       we will use it most of the time.

// Why should we use arrays? //

// None.

// Creating and initializing arrays //
//----------------------------------//
console.log("Creating and initializing arrays");

// 1. Study the following sequence: 1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 15, 14, 42, ...
//    Create an array with the first 25 elements of this sequence.
//    Obviously this has to be done programmatically.

var sequence = [1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 15, 14, 42];

for (var i = 8; i < 25; i++) {
    sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] * sequence[i-2];
};

console.log(sequence);

// Adding elements //
//-----------------//
console.log("Adding elements");

// Use this array to answer the questions below.
var arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

// 1. Add 9 and 10 to the end of the array. Make sure you keep the order.
arr.push(9, 10);
// 2. Add 0 and 1 to the beginning of the array. Make sure you keep the order.
arr.unshift(0, 1);


//-------------------//
// Removing elements //
//-------------------//
console.log("Removing elements");

// Use the array from the 'Adding elements' section.

// 1. Remove 9 and 10 from the end of the array.

arr.pop(9);
arr.pop(10);

// 2. Remove 0 and 1 from the beginning of the array.
arr.shift(0);
arr.shift(1);


//-------------------------------------------------------//
// Adding and removing elements from a specific position //
//-------------------------------------------------------//
console.log("Adding and removing elements from a specific position");

// Use the array from the 'Adding elements' section.

// 1. Remove all elements except the first and last.
arr.shift();
arr.pop();

// 2. Insert the numbers that were just removed back into the array.

arr.unshift(5,6,7);


// NOTE: arr should be back to its original state at this point.

// Two-dimensional and multidimensional arrays //
//---------------------------------------------//
console.log("Two-dimensional and multidimensional arrays");

// 1. Multiply the row elements together in the two dimensional array below
//    and then sum the result. So for the array below one would get
//    (1*2*3)+(4*5*6)+(7*8*9). Print the result to the console.
//    NOTE: obviously the code should still work if the numbers in the array
//          are changed.
var twoDimensionalArray = [[1, 2, 3],

// Use the following two arrays to answer the next questions.

var positiveNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0];
var negativeNumbers = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1];

// 1. Create a new array 'numbers' from the above arrays that contains all
//    numbers in order.

var numbers = positiveNumbers.concat(negativeNumbers);

var numbers = null; // to be changed

// 2. Check if some numbers in the numbers array are larger than or equal to 0
//    and print the result to the console.

function checkIfSomeNumbersAreLargerThanOrEqualToZero(numbers) {
  for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] >= 0) {
      return true;

// 3. Create a new array that only contains the odd numbers from the numbers
//    array.  
var oddNumbers = [];

for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 !== 0) {
    oddNumbers.push(numbers[i]);

// Only read ECMAScript sections.

// The following text is from the all the Amendments in the Bill of Rights.
